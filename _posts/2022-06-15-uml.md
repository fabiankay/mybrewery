The UML Class Diagram demonstrates a partly complete implementation of the brewing application. The focus of this part in the mybrewery ecosystem focuses on the creation and management of beer recipes. Moreover, the brewing application initiates new brewing sessions. The diagram shows the main functions for each class. One essential part of the diagram are the enumerations for certain attributes. To manage the complexity of the application, the specification of some options in advance is highly benefitial.

For the ingredients, the first iteration used enumeration as well. During the second itertion of the diagram, the enumeration was replaced by an inheritance pattern where all ingredients inherit from a ingredients parent class. One reason for this decision was the ability to implement different attributes for the ingredients. This would have caused problems when using enumerations.
